            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a full stack web developer and mobile developer with a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly applications.
                With 3 years of experience in the industry, I have developed a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My expertise lies in building scalable and performant web applications using modern frameworks like React.
                I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have a deep understanding of responsive design principles.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the backend, I have worked extensively with Node.js and Express to develop RESTful APIs and handle database operations.
                I am also experienced in working with databases such as MongoDB and MySQL.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to Node.js, I have experience with the Django framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
                I have worked with Django&apos;s ORM to handle database operations and create RESTful APIs.
                I am proficient in Python and have a strong understanding of Django&apos;s architecture and best practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to web development, I have a strong interest in mobile app development.
                I have built native Android applications using Kotlin, which allows me to leverage my existing web development skills to create native experiences for Android.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented developer, always striving to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices.
